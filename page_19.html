    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a multi-view SPA to deconstruct the dense report. The default view is the 'Interactive Workflow', a visual representation of the 4 phases and 14 steps, allowing users to click and explore details on demand. This is more engaging than a linear document. A top navigation switches to two other views: 'Foundational Pillars' which isolates the core concepts (Identity, Tech, Governance, Architecture) for focused learning, and 'Operational Levers', an interactive dashboard. This dashboard allows users to select a specific operational category (e.g., 'Inputs', 'KPIs', 'Activation Levers') and see that information collated from all 14 steps. This matrix-like view is designed for strategists and practitioners who need to compare and synthesize information across the entire workflow, a task difficult with the original report format. This structure prioritizes user-driven exploration and synthesis over passive reading. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: 14-step workflow -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Viz: Interactive HTML/CSS diagram -> Interaction: Click to reveal details -> Justification: Breaks down complexity, improves navigation. | Report Info: Detailed step breakdowns (Inputs, Outputs, etc.) -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Tabbed content cards -> Interaction: Click tabs -> Justification: Prevents information overload. | Report Info: Foundational pillars -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: 4-column layout with expandable sections -> Interaction: Click to expand -> Justification: Organizes conceptual knowledge cleanly. | Report Info: Operational Levers (KPIs, Assets) -> Goal: Compare/Synthesize -> Viz: Dropdown-controlled content display -> Interaction: Select from dropdown -> Justification: Enables powerful cross-cutting analysis. | Report Info: Predictive Scoring -> Goal: Inform/Illustrate -> Viz: Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) -> Interaction: Hover for tooltips -> Justification: Makes the abstract concept of feature importance tangible and visual. -->
